# BATANI
**BATANI** is a mobile application designed to help farmers predict harvest prices and receive plant recommendations based on their location. It utilizes machine learning models to analyze local data and predict the best crops for farmers to plant, maximizing their yield and profitability.

## Description
BATANI uses advanced algorithms to predict crop prices based on historical data and weather patterns. It also suggests optimal crops suited for the user's location, helping farmers make data-driven decisions to improve productivity and sustainability.

- **Price Prediction**: Get price predictions for different crops up to next 12 month.
- **Plant Recommendations**: Receive tailored suggestions on which crops are most suitable for your location and season.

This project is part of a capstone project focused on using technology to support agricultural productivity.
